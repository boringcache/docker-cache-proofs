# docker-cache-proofs

Public benchmark runner for comparing Docker and build caches on real upstream projects.

Each case pins an upstream repository and source revision so fresh and rolling runs remain reproducible.

## Source Model

- Docker cases live in [`cases/`](cases/).
- Cases use upstream Dockerfiles and build contexts unless an explicit benchmark overlay is part of the case.

## What It Measures

Docker cases compare:

- GitHub Actions Cache
- BoringCache OCI cache
- BoringCache BuildKit backend

Fresh runs seed an isolated cache from the pinned source. Rolling runs build a later pinned revision against the same stable cache scope.

## Workflows

- [`Docker Benchmark`](.github/workflows/docker-cache-proofs.yml)
- [`Canary Benchmark`](.github/workflows/canary-dispatch.yml) runs the selected canary CLI and BuildKit image against the curated Docker cases in [`.canary/candidates.txt`](.canary/candidates.txt).

## Output

Each run uploads machine-readable JSON and Markdown summaries using the same artifact shape as the other BoringCache benchmark repositories.
